# Playing with Machine Learning on the Titanic dataset
This repository is an accumulation of analysis that I have been running on the Titanic dataset, from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Kaggle Titanic competition</a>. 

I started off by writing my own analysis and visualization scripts, and gradually incorporated more established ML methods.

I will be writing up from time to time some explanatory entries, of what I did. For now, you can refer to the ``titanic_class.py`` file, which contains the main ``Titanic`` class I wrote that loads the data and offers methods to analyze them. There are also a few ``run*.py`` files which contain scripts for doing one analysis or another, using the ``Titanic`` class.
